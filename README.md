**Introduction (Includes Problem Statement and Background Information)**

Terry Stops are a legal means of detainment and search of individuals for 'reasonable suspicion'. Unfortunately, 'reasonable suspicion' is a vague legal term and often implicit bias can play a role in the stop and the arrest. Black communities and communities of color have been impacted by Terry Stops disproprotionately, you may have heard or even experience it as a traffic stop or stop and frisk. Although Terry Stops are legal, it is important for municipalities and states to collect this important data to determine if particular communities are disproportionately stopped. This is one way to identify implicit bias and take action.
